# 🔐 CyberProjects

This repository contains a collection of beginner to intermediate **Cybersecurity-focused Python projects**, built for learning and demonstrating core concepts in encryption, password security, keylogging, and vulnerability awareness.

---

## 📁 Projects Included

| Project Name              | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **CaeserCypher** | A GUI-based implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classical encryption technique, built using PyQt5 with an animated GIF background and modern UI styling. |
| **PasswordStrengthChecker** | Analyzes user-entered passwords for complexity based on length, uppercase/lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Gives feedback on password strength. |
| **ImageEncryptorApp**       | A GUI-based application that encrypts and decrypts image files using a key-based shuffle algorithm. Built using `CustomTkinter` with a dark UI theme. |
| **KeyloggerDemo**           | A minimal educational keylogger that records keyboard inputs to a file for ethical research purposes. Includes timestamp logging and UI extensions. |
